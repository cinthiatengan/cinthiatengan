### **Welcome to my Github Page!**
Hi guys! I'm Cinthia Tengan, a fresh graduated in Geophysics by the University of Sao Paulo  (2019).
In the world of programmig, I consider myself a little child learning with excitiment and determination about programming,
even that I've already had some introductory steps in C at USP. Nowadays, I have been granted an opportunity to participate
in the Generation Brasil Java Developer Bootcamp, so in my repository you will see a lot of what I'm learning and producing in this marvelous bootcamp.
