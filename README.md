## **Welcome to my Github Page!**

<div align="center">
    I’m 31 years old, born and raised in Brazil. I really like to be in a change transition, seeking for new challenges, 
that's why even though I am a graduated geo scientist, I’m looking forward to the technology area. Because technology was 
always with me, since I was a little child when I used to enjoy spending lots of time playing video games and computer games 
like warcraft II, a real time strategy game.  Nowadays, this passion surpases time, because I still play online games when I 
have some free time, meeting new people, enhancing my english, learning strategy and most importantly, having fun. Having this 
opportunity to participate in the Generation Brazil Java Web Developer Junior, has granted me much more than just hard and soft 
skills, like the real understanding that we are capable to learn everything we want if we put effort and determination in it. 
We just need an opportunity to prove our valor independent of the color of our skin, gender, social class and sexual orientation. 
That's what I believe and I hope in the future I can return all the good opportunities I had access to other people who wouldn’t 
have the same living conditions that I had like financial support from my parents, living in a not violent environment, good health 
support, etc. Opportunity changes lives, and now my dream is to make them reachable to everyone, to change our community inside out.

I really like to stay at home, playing in my computer games like Overwatch and World of Warcraft, watching anime (I have a personal profile in MyAnimeList). Sometimes I would spend some time drawing tattoos design, and rarely I go fishing because most of the time I'm broke, so I can't go so often :laughing: but its my favorite sport!

:fork_and_knife: Favorite foods: Sushi, hamburguer and icecream.   
:couple_with_heart: Boyfriend: Rafael Guisso  
:dog: Pets: a dog (Bolt) and a cockatiel (Tico)  
:anger: Hate: Prejudice, fanaticism
